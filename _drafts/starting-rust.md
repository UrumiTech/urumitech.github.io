# Starting Rust

## What Is Rust?
Rust is a multi-paradigm, read multiple classifications, programming language. It has been designed for performance and safety. It is especially concurrency safe. It is very similar to C++ syntactically, however it can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. It achieves this without a garbage collector (GC). In Rust reference counting is optional. 

## Where and When did the Rust Language happen?
The Rust language started in 2006 as a personal project for an employee, named Graydon Hoare, of Mozilla. Rust 1.0 was release in 2015
