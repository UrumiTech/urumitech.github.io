Delivering software is not the easiest thing to accomplish. A lot can go wrong with the project and the development team. In this article, we will give some easy fixes to get things back on track.


## "Project Is Delayed Again!!!"

If the above phrase is said regularly regarding a Software project you have had going on for a long time, then you need to address a few key things in your organisation.


### Business Issues

#### Software is not a revenue generator

Unless you are tech start up, your main business revenue is not coming from the internal software development team. As a result, these teams tend to become neglected or misunderstood. These teams tend to be started to reduce costs as hiring a third party to maintain an application may become cost prohibitive over time. The application, this team looks after does not bring in any revenue but is used by the entire organisation. 

#### Agile is only for Developers
Modern Development teams tend to work using Agile methodologies. Most organisations do not like Agile Methodologies because of a perceived loss of control of what the developers are doing. Sometimes Agile methodologies are detested because the organisation works due to the personalities rather than a set of processes.

#### Not understanding how an application is made
Most organisations see internal software teams like the electricity in the building. For most businesses, software built by these teams should just work, changes are seamless and deployments occur without down time. All the points above are possible for even a small software delivery team. However, due to how an organisation uses its software delivery team these are pipe dreams, rather than reality.

#### Not realising the scope of a software project
A lot of the time, software projects are delayed as the business has simply underestimated the scope of the project.



### Software Delivery Team Issues

#### Siloes
For many software delivery teams, work becomes siloed. People over time become domain experts and thus take ownership over an application or part of an application. This can lead to siloes of work, especially if the wrong type of person is the owner. Siloes of work are bad, as they essentially create a single point of failure for your entire delivery process.

#### Technical Debt
When a team builds software, ideally it should be well engineered and extendable. However, due to constraints, a team will deploy a quick fix instead. It is like using a credit card to buy something that you need, but currently cannot afford. For most people, as long as they pay of the balance at the end of the month, they do not incur any additional costs. Technical Debt is analogous to using a credit card. Should a team not pay of the Technical Debt in a timely manner, the Technical Debt will increase exponentially. Ultimately the software project will reach a point where it will need to be rewritten.     


### Shared Issues

#### Excessive Scope Creep
Excessive Scope Creep is hidden enemy of delivering software projects. There will always be a level of scope creep in all projects, it is to be expected. Should scope creep not be managed well, it can cause complete stagnation of a project. The main causes of excessive scope creep are:

1. The business not understanding the full ramifications of a particular change.
2. Developers underestimating the complexity of a task or story.
3. Project Stakeholders changing their minds within a small-time frame.
4. Project Leads and project Managers not managing Project Stakeholders.

All these issues can be mitigated by applying sensible Agile Practices.

## 7 Rules for Getting Your Software Project Back on Track

1. List out all your work, regardless of the size or effort of the work.
2. Build mission teams and set a delivery cadence.
3. Make sure your software delivery team are empowered to pay off any bad Technical Debt.
4. Review the work regularly and be honest about the project progress.
5. Make small, manageable improvements to delivery process.
6. "Feature Delivered" must mean the end user can use the feature.
7. Celebrate your deliveries.

## Conclusion
For software projects to fail, it is, almost, never caused by a particular technology. Software project failures are, almost, always caused by miscommunication between those who sponsor the project and those who implement the project. Improving communication and building good Software Delivery processes into the team will ensure that these failures are never catastrophic. Keeping this simple and easily understandable by both the Stakeholders and the implementers
